      "halving_event_section_1": "In the Nervos ecosystem, mining is used to secure the network and distribute tokens in the form of block rewards. A total of 33.6 billion CKB tokens will be created through primary issuance over a period of approximately 84 years to incentivize the miners that secure the network.",
      "halving_event_section_2": "Every epoch, a period of approximately four hours, a fixed amount of 1,917,808 CKB is introduced. Every 8,760 epochs, a period of approximately four years, this amount is cut in half. This event is called a halving and it is the point where the mining rewards from primary issuance are permanently reduced by 50%. This halving process will continue every four years until the year 2103, after which point all block rewards from primary issuance will cease completely.",
      "significance": "What is the Significance of a Halving?",
      "significance_section_1": "Each time a halving occurs, it causes a sharp decrease in the rewards generated per block. The supply of new CKB entering circulation is lowered, dramatically reducing the rate of inflation. This is important because it creates a shift in the underlying market equilibrium and forces a reevaluation of what is considered fair market value.",
      "significance_section_2": "Halving events occur on a predetermined issuance schedule that cannot be changed, postponed, or delayed.

The duration of an Epoch is set to 4 hours, so the actual Epoch interval is always **around** 4 hours, and all the blocks in the same Epoch share the same difficulty target. The difficulty adjustment algorithm aims to stabilize the orphan block rate at 2.5% by adjusting the difficulty level for each Epoch based on the average block time of the previous Epoch. The Epoch is used to ensure that the network remains secure and that miners are incentivized to continue mining the network. The Epoch concept is used in many other blockchain networks as well, and is an important component of the consensus mechanism.",
      "epoch_start_number": "In CKB, Epoch Start Number refers to the block number at which a new Epoch begins. The Epoch Start Number is calculated based on the number of blocks that have been mined since the last Epoch started. Specifically, the Epoch Start Number is equal to the current block number minus the remainder of the current block number divided by the Epoch length. For example, if the current block number is 1000 and the Epoch length is 180 blocks, then the Epoch Start Number would be 1000 - (1000 % 180) = 900. The Epoch Start Number is used to determine when the difficulty level for Proof of Work (PoW) mining should be adjusted, and is an important component of the consensus mechanism in CKB.",
      "block_index": "In CKB, Block Index refers to the numerical index assigned to a block in the blockchain. The Block Index is a unique identifier for each block in the chain, and is used to order the blocks in the blockchain. The first block in the chain, also known as the Genesis Block, has a Block Index of 0, and each subsequent block is assigned the next sequential index. The Block Index is an important component of the blockchain, as it is used to maintain the integrity and security of the network by ensuring that all nodes on the network agree on the ordering of the blocks in the chain.",

      "transactions_root": "In CKB, Transactions Root refers to the root of a Merkle tree that contains the transaction hashes of all the transactions included in a block. The Transactions Root is calculated by hashing together all of the transaction hashes in the Merkle tree, and is included in the block header as a way of verifying the integrity of the transactions in the block. The Transactions Root is used to ensure that all of the transactions in the block are valid and that none have been tampered with. It is also used to efficiently retrieve a specific transaction from a block, as the Merkle tree structure allows for quick verification of the transaction's inclusion in the block. The Transactions Root is an important component of the consensus mechanism in CKB.",

The Lock Script is executed by the CKB VM during the transaction verification process.",
      "type_script": "Type Script in CKB is a script that is attached to a Cell's type field. It is used to enforce additional validation rules on the Cell's data. The Type Script can be used to define custom data formats, or to implement more complex validation logic beyond what is possible with the Lock Script alone.

Unlike Base Issuance, Secondary Issuance is not distributed to everyone on the network, but rather targeted at users who occupy space on Nervos or hold their CKBytes outside of Nervos DAO. The CKBytes from Secondary Issuance are used to collect state rent and are distributed to miners who maintain the network (State Rent), Nervos DAO users, and the Nervos Treasury. CKBytes holders can lock their tokens in Nervos DAO to gain interest in a similar manner to staking on other platforms, which offsets the long-term inflationary effects of Secondary Issuance exactly, resulting in no loss of value over time.",
